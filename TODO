# Phase 3

[] To enable video streaming in your Django site, you can follow these general steps:
    [] 1. Store the video files in a directory on your 
    server or in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or 
    Google Cloud Storage.
    [] 2. Use a media server like Nginx, Apache or HLS to 
    serve the video files to clients. These media servers 
    can handle requests for video files and deliver them 
    to clients over HTTP.
    [] 3. In your Django views, you can generate URLs to 
    the video files based on their filename or ID in your 
    database.
    [] 4. Include a video player in your HTML templates to 
    play the videos. Popular options include Video.js, JW 
    Player, and Plyr.
    [] 5. For live video streaming, you will need to use a 
    streaming protocol like RTMP or HLS, and a media server 
    that supports live streaming.
[] Here are some additional tips and resources for implementing 
video streaming in Django:
    [] - Use a media server that is optimized for video streaming. 
    Nginx and Apache both have modules for serving video files over 
    HTTP, and HLS is a popular streaming protocol that can be used 
    with both servers.
    [] - Consider using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute 
    your videos. A CDN can cache your video files at edge locations 
    around the world, reducing latency and improving playback performance 
    for viewers.
    [] - For live video streaming, consider using a service like AWS 
    Elemental MediaLive or Wowza Streaming Engine to handle the video 
    encoding and delivery.
    [] - Make sure to set the appropriate MIME type for video files in 
    your HTTP response headers. For example, for MP4 files, you should 
    set the MIME type to `video/mp4`.
    [] - Use video encoding settings that are optimized for web playback. 
    H.264 is a popular video codec for web video, and the MP4 container 
    format is widely supported by modern browsers.
    [] - Test your video streaming implementation thoroughly across different 
    browsers and devices to ensure smooth playback and optimal performance.
    [] - Here's a good tutorial that covers the basics of implementing video 
    streaming in Django using Nginx and Video.js:
