Yes, you can combine Ajax and React to create dynamic and interactive web applications. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for making asynchronous HTTP requests to retrieve and send data from a web server.

React provides a powerful framework for managing the UI state and rendering components, while Ajax allows you to fetch data from a server without refreshing the entire page. By combining these technologies, you can create React components that make Ajax requests to fetch or update data and then dynamically update the UI based on the response.

Here's a basic example of how you can combine Ajax and React:

1. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install axios react
   ```

2. Import the required modules in your React component:
   ```jsx
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import axios from 'axios';
   ```

3. Create a component that fetches data using Ajax:
   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     const [data, setData] = useState([]);

     useEffect(() => {
       axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
         .then(response => setData(response.data))
         .catch(error => console.error(error));
     }, []);

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Data fetched using Ajax:</h1>
         <ul>
           {data.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

4. Render the component:
   ```jsx
   ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook is used to perform the Ajax request when the component mounts. The response data is stored in the component's state using the `useState` hook. The UI is then updated based on the fetched data.

Remember to handle errors and loading states appropriately, and you can also implement Ajax requests for other operations like submitting form data or updating server data.

Keep in mind that there are other libraries and approaches you can use for making Ajax requests in React, such as the built-in `fetch` API or other popular libraries like Axios or Fetch API. The above example uses Axios for simplicity.
